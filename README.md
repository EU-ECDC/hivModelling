# HIV Modelling tool

Implements evidence-based methods to calculate HIV incidence in a given population.
This tool can estimate:

1. the number of people living with HIV, including those not yet
diagnosed;
2. the annual number of new HIV infections; the average time between infection and
diagnosis;
3. the number of people in need of treatment according to CD4 cell counts.
